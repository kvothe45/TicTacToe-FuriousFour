This program was created in Eclipse.  This is a JavaFx file using openjfx 17.0.1.  Because JavaFX does not come packaged with Java since version 11 you will need to get and install JavaFX on your IDE.  Good instructions on that can be found in the references (Barclay, 2020) (Bro Code, 2020).  Once that is configured you will be able to run the program.  Each game stops when there is a win, lose, or draw.  To start a new game just hit the "New Game" button.  "Reset Stats" will start a new game and reset all the player's stats to 0.  The first player of each game is always Player 1 with either the X or cat token.  Player 2 will be the the O or dog token.
